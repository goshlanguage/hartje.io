This site is powered by hugo. I personally love the simplicity of writing markdown and having something else transpile it into HTML that doesn't look horrible. There are a lot of tools in this space, such as the popular `Sphinx` and `Mkdocs` of python fame, and `Jekyll` (and `Hugo`) of Go.

I chose `hugo` specifically only because there is already extensive documentation of how to setup a simple hugo site on github pages. If you're not familiar, Github will host your files in a webserver so you can either use their free DNS (*.github.io), or use your own. If you want to learn more, see the [Github Pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
