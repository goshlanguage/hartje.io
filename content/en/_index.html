        <strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
    </p>

    <span class="terminal ps-5 d-block">
        Tenstorrent | Tesla | Equinix | Microsoft | WPEngine | BankRate | Hostgator <br />
        <br />

        Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience across AI, Datacenter automation, Cloud services, and Hosting. <br />
        Ryan has led teams and projects, coaching and mentoring engineers to deliver reliable, scalable results. <br />
        <br />

        Experience includes building three clouds and ten years of Kubernetes in production. He focuses on resilient, <br />
        observable, and maintainable microservice architectures. His work emphasizes network segmentation resilience <br />
        and caching strategies including Redis, Docker pull-through caches, and artifact/package repositories. <br />
        <br />

        He has developed production-grade services in Go and Python, maintained front-end systems in TypeScript,<br />
        and authored API middleware and gRPC services derived from OpenAPI specifications. Performance optimization <br />
        and feedback loops were established using fio, k6, and continuous benchmarking. <br />
        <br />

        He has guided teams in establishing observability and telemetry standards using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and <br />
        distributed tracing to provide deep visibility into system performance and reliability. <br />
        <br />

        Ryan advocates for engineering from first principles and believes strong test automation is key to <br />
        safe, sustainable release velocity. <br />
